A database consists of an organized collection of data for one or more uses.

In a sense, a database is a generalization and expansion of data structures. 

But the difference is that a database is usually external to individual programs and permanent in existence compared to data structures.

Databases are used when the data volume is large or logical relations between data items are important. 

The factors considered in database design include performance, concurrency, integrity, and recovery from hardware failures.[^1]
